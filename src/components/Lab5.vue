            <v-card-text>I took a short video that I took a while ago and editted it to match the requirements of the assignment. I created a title page and end page in powerpoint and clipped the video so all 
                together the video would be a minute long. Then I clipped the background music as well and sped it up so that the section I wanted would fit just nicely into a minute long video. Finally
                I added the naration titles to match with the video and the music. This was all done in Open Shot. I exported the video in mp4 format and uploaded it to my website.
