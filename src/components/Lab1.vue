                        <li>A navigation bar is unneeded for the content of this website. A single page will suffice.</li>
                        <li>Header makes the student and goal of the website clear to the user. </li>
                        <li>Layout is clean and without clutter. Related categories are together and important parts are highlighted.</li>
                        <li>A graphic is used to break up the monotony of text and improve the look of the site.</li>
                        <li>A simple color palette is used. Using too many different colors would make the size look cluttered and disoranized.</li>
                        <li>Links remain in purple and are highlighted black on hover to communicate their clickability.</li>
                        <li>Pure HTML and CSS are used to keep the site lightweight and quick to load.</li>
                        <li>Components are sufficiently spaced apart to seperate irrelavent information and keep relevant information together.</li>
                        <li>A white background is used for places with text for further ease of reading.</li>
                        <li>Font Chosen is Arial, a universal and easy to read font.</li>
