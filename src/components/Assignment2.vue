                            On December 31st of 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported to WHO in China. The next month, on January 30th  the outbreak of coronavirus was declared a Public Health Emergency of International concern and on the 11th of March was labelled a worldwide pandemic by WHO. It is currently April 5th, 2020 and we are in the midst of a worldwide crisis. Restaurants have shut down, people have secluded themselves in their homes, flights have stopped, and many people are unable to work, while others working at hospitals and grocery stores are over capacity. Many people have been impacted by this outbreak and we are still waiting to see how it will further impact all of our lives. People have lost their jobs, become unable to pay their rent, and become stuck in abroad countries unable to fly back to their loved ones. During these hard times, we must all do everything that we can to prevent further spread of the disease so that we can go back to our normal lives as soon as possible. Now, what can be done to put a stop to this pandemic? What does everyone need to do? Well, the answer is, nothing! Or, to put it more specifically, social distancing. In the worldâ€™s time of need, what everyone needs to be doing is distancing themselves as much as possible from interactions with other people. All we need to do is put our lives on a short pause, take a breather, relax at home, and put an end to this outbreak for good. Now, how will simply socially distancing ourselves help to fix such a huge problem? The thing is, the real danger of the outbreak of covid-19 is the massive influx of sick people that will put huge loads onto our healthcare systems. Hospitals becoming over capacity will mean even further raised death rates, and that is not only for people afflicted with covid-19, but death rates for every type of illness will go up if your hospitals become unable to handle the loads. By social distancing, we can flatten the burdens placed on our hospitals and enable them to do their jobs properly. Covid-19 is transmitted through droplets that are produced when we sneeze, cough, talk, and even breathe. This means that if you are interacting with other people on a regular basis, the likelihood of getting infected is extremely high as droplets can remain in the air, potentially infecting people who breathe it in. To combat this, social distancing is our greatest, and most effective weapon. So, let us all cooperate to combat this virus. Hole up in your home, learn a new skill, read some books, or maybe pick up a new hobby. If we all cooperate, these hard times will be over before we know it.
