                            In the summer of last year, I took a solo trip to Japan. I saved up money from doing UberEats and used some of my scholarship money to fund the trip. 
                            It ended up being one of the best trips of my life. I arrived in Tokyo on July 5th without anything really planned, but one of my friends happened to be in 
                            the area and offered to show me around. She took me to a variety of Japanese Izakaya and we had a great time. July 7th I arranged to have a professional 
                            photoshoot in Kita Senju through AirBnB and had a great morning walking around, chatting and taking pictures with the photographer. For dinner, I met one 
                            of my long-time penpals for the first time and we had Wagyu beef at a restaurant in Shibuya. The next day I took a anime tour of Akihabara, I met a lot of 
                            awesome people and had a blast. Then it was off to Osaka to meet my friend and his family flying in from Toronto. I visited the university that one of my 
                            friends was attending and got to eat an amazing lunch in the school cafeteria. Then toured around the beautiful Namba Parks shopping mall. July 11th my friends 
                            from Toronto arrives and I tag along with his family for sight-seeing for the remaining 2 weeks. We visited popular tourist attractions such as Kinkakuji, 
                            Fushimi inari, Arashiyama, Kiyomizu Dera, and more. It was amazing to see so many places in Japan and everyone was justifiably pooped. The last night before my flight, 
                            we were staying in an onsen and lit some farewell fireworks. Thank you for an amazing trip, Japan. I will be back.

            <v-card-text>I created this video using the default windows 10 video editor and audacity. First, I created a script for the video and recorded myself reading it aloud.
                I then got an downloaded an audio file of music that I thought would fit the mood of my script well and used audacity to add in track. The original music was way to loud
                to hear what I was saying so I had to edit multiple parts to soften the music and also gradually increase the volume in the end once I finish talking. After the audio track
                was finished, I imported it into my video editing software and selected images from my 2019 Japan trip that I thought represented the trip well. I had way too many images and
                sorting through them took a while. One of the difficulties I had is that the song is a quite long piece whereas our video is only supposed to be around a minute long so I had trouble
                finding a good spot for the video to end on that matched with the music. I had to slow down the original music in order for it to line up with my script and even then, the ending feels 
                awkward with the music just cutting off abruptly, but I don't think theres anything else I could have done. The difficulty of this assignment was very reasonable (5 / 10) and I enjoyed 
                getting the chance to create content that is more personal to me.
