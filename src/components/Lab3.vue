                I like this assignment because it has a scalable difficulty depending on how good you want your website to look. I like that I have the option to make it look really nice when I have time, but if I'm really busy during that week, I don't have to worry too much about it. I enjoyed fiddling around with images in photoshop as well as it gave me the chance to experiment and have fun.

                    <li>I lightened the colors on this image a lot in order for the words written in the sand to show better. I also made the sky colors much whiter so that the photo appears to be in the day time rather than sunset. </li>
                    <li>The size has gotten a little larger, however both images are jpg and originally quite small. The resolution of the image has not been affected.</li>
                    <li>I used a reference photo and drew ontop of that, filling in areas with color. My goal was to capture the areas with color and focus on the shadow being a different color without using a huge color palette. I only used 6 colors throughout. </li>
                </ol>
