            <v-card-text>
                This website is acting as a medium to display the work completed in the BTH645 course at Seneca College. A variety of multimedias will be displayed in this website which discuss the usability of websites and various other aspects of multimedia. This page is going to be talking about text as a medium and this block of text here will introduce me as an individual. I am currently a 3rd year software development student at Seneca College. My expected graduation date at the end of the summer of 2021. Once I graduate I plan to move to Japan and work in the IT sector. I have been studying Japanese for 3 years now in order to work in Japan once I graduate. I have previously completed a 6-month volunteering placement before I enrolled into college and loved it so much that ever since then, all I can think about is going back.

                    <li>Text font should be appropriately chosen for its purpose. Professional fonts should be used to uphold your website's image.</li>
                    <li>Text size should be larger for titles and smaller for content to communicate it's importance to the reader.</li>
                    <li>Text should be aligned so that it makes sense of which title it refers to and stays within the bounds of it's related components.</li>
                    <li>Bold should be used to emphasize important points.</li>
                    <li>Italics can also be used for emphasis, but are more widely used to refer to other works or to mimic whispering.</li>
                    <li>Text heavy websites should split up the text blocks so that it doesn't overwhelm the reader.</li>
                    <li>Tabs can be used for indicate that more detailed explanation is being provided.</li>
                    <li>Text color should be chosen for easy readability and also emphasis. It needs to contrast it's background so that it can be read easily.</li>
                    <li>The website's color palette should be in sync with the text's color. If the text's color doesn't match, the website will look strange.</li>
                    <li>Things that can be communicated in an image rather than text should be. Humans absorb images much quicker than text.</li>
